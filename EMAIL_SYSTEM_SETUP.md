# 🎯 NXTRIX Email Automation - Production Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your email automation system is ready for production! Follow these steps to deploy:

### 1. Set Up Gmail SMTP (5 minutes)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - **Save this password** - you'll need it for Netlify

### 2. Configure Netlify Environment Variables (2 minutes)

In your Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables, add:

```
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password-from-step-1
ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN=create-a-secure-random-password
```

**Important:** The `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN` should be a strong, unique password for admin access.

### 3. Run Database Migration (1 minute)

Copy and paste this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE waitlist 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS credentials_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS launch_notified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS temporary_password TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS access_date TIMESTAMPTZ;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS email_logs (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,
    message_id TEXT,
    sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

UPDATE waitlist 
SET credentials_sent = FALSE, launch_notified = FALSE 
WHERE credentials_sent IS NULL OR launch_notified IS NULL;
```

### 4. Test the System (2 minutes)

1. Visit: `https://nxtrix.netlify.app/admin_email_campaigns.html`
2. Enter your `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Send a test welcome email to verify everything works

## 📧 Email Flow Overview

### ✅ Automatic Welcome Emails

- **Trigger:** Stripe webhook (already implemented)
- **Content:** Welcome message, founders benefits, next steps
- **Status:** Live and working

### 🔑 Login Credentials Campaign
- **When:** 2 weeks before platform launch
- **Trigger:** Manual via admin panel
- **Content:** Login URL, temporary password, access instructions
- **Action:** Click "Send Credentials" in admin panel

### 🚀 Launch Notifications
- **When:** Platform goes live
- **Trigger:** Manual via admin panel  
- **Content:** "We're live!" announcement, feature highlights
- **Action:** Click "Send Launch Notice" in admin panel

## 🔧 Production Workflow

### For Founders Launch (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Monitor welcome emails** - Check that new signups receive welcome emails
2. **Prepare for credentials** - 2 weeks before launch, use admin panel to send login credentials
3. **Launch day** - Send launch notifications to all founders

### Admin Panel Access
- **URL:** `https://nxtrix.netlify.app/admin_email_campaigns.html`
- **Auth:** Use your `ADMIN_AUTH_TOKEN`
- **Features:** Send campaigns, test emails, monitor status

## 📊 Email Templates

All templates are professionally designed with:
- ✅ NXTRIX branding and colors
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

- ✅ Founders-specific benefits highlighting

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ Environment variables for all sensitive data
- ✅ Admin token authentication for campaign triggers
- ✅ Secure password generation for login credentials

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Email Logs
All emails are automatically logged to `email_logs` table with:
- Recipient email
- Email type (welcome, login_credentials, launch_notification)
- Status (sent/failed)
- Timestamp and message ID

### Database Tracking
The `waitlist` table tracks:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Gmail Authentication Issues
