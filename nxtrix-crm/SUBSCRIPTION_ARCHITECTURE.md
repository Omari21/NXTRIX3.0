### 🏗️ Architecture Components

#### 1. Subscription Manager (`subscription_manager.py`)
**Core subscription management and feature gating system**

```python
# Key Classes:
- SubscriptionTier: Enum for tier levels
- FeatureLimits: Dataclass defining usage limits
- SubscriptionInfo: User subscription details
- SubscriptionManager: Central management class

# Key Functions:
- get_user_subscription(): Get user's current subscription
- check_feature_access(): Validate feature access
- check_usage_limit(): Enforce usage limits
- increment_usage(): Track feature usage
- upgrade_subscription(): Handle tier upgrades
```

#### 2. Feature Access Control (`feature_access_control.py`)
**Middleware layer for enforcing restrictions across modules**

```python
# Key Decorators:
@require_subscription(feature, usage_type)  # Feature + usage gating
@require_tier(tier)                        # Tier-based access
@require_feature(feature_name)             # Feature-specific access
@track_usage(usage_type)                   # Automatic usage tracking

# Key Classes:
- FeatureAccessControl: Central access management
- BulkOperationContext: Context manager for bulk operations
```

#### 3. Subscription Dashboard (`subscription_dashboard.py`)
**Admin interface and user subscription management**

```python
# Admin Features:
- User management and tier changes
- Usage analytics and reporting
- Billing history and revenue tracking
- Feature adoption analytics
- System maintenance tools

# User Features:
- Subscription status overview
- Usage tracking and limits
- Upgrade options and pricing
- Feature comparison matrix
```

#### 4. Database Schema (`subscription_schema.sql`)
**Comprehensive database structure for subscription management**

```sql
-- Core Tables:
- subscription_usage: Track usage per billing cycle
- feature_access_log: Audit trail of feature access
- subscription_events: Subscription change history
- subscription_limits: Configurable tier limits
- team_members: Multi-user team management
- billing_history: Payment and billing records
- feature_overrides: Manual feature flags

-- Key Functions:
- check_usage_limit(): PostgreSQL function for limit validation
- increment_usage(): Usage counter management
- reset_billing_cycle(): Billing cycle management
```

### 🔐 Implementation Examples

#### Basic Feature Gating
```python
@require_feature("ai_deal_analysis")
@track_feature_usage("ai_queries_per_month")
def analyze_deal_with_ai(deal_data):
    # AI analysis logic here
    return analysis_results
```

#### Tier-Based Access
```python
@require_tier("enterprise")
def bulk_import_deals(deals_data):
    # Enterprise-only bulk operations
    return import_results
```

#### Usage Limit Enforcement
```python
def create_deal(deal_data):
    user_id = st.session_state.user_id
    
    # Check limits before creation
    has_access, current, limit = check_usage_limit(user_id, "deals_per_month")
    
    if not has_access:
        show_upgrade_prompt("deal_tracker")
        return False
    
    # Create deal and increment usage
    deal_id = save_deal(deal_data)
    increment_usage(user_id, "deals_per_month")
    
    return deal_id
```

#### Bulk Operations with Context Manager
```python
def bulk_import_deals(deals_data):
    user_id = st.session_state.user_id
    
    # Check if bulk operation would exceed limits
    with BulkOperationContext(user_id, "deals_per_month", len(deals_data)):
        imported_count = 0
        for deal in deals_data:
            if save_deal(deal):
                imported_count += 1
        
        return imported_count
    # Usage automatically tracked on successful completion
```
